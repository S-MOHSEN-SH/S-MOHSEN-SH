🚀 **Full Stack Developer** | 💻 **Backend Engineer** | 🌐 **API Specialist**

🔧 I specialize in building scalable, high-performance applications with a strong focus on **backend development** using **Node.js**, **NestJS**, and **Express.js**, as well as **frontend development** with **React** and **Redux**. 
    With a passion for crafting robust, efficient, and user-friendly solutions, I bring a full-stack approach to my projects.

🔍 **My expertise includes:**
- **Backend Development** with Node.js (Express.js, NestJS, Hapi.js)
- **Frontend Development** with React.js, **Redux**, and **Ant Design**
- **API Design & Integration** (RESTful APIs, GraphQL, third-party services)
- **Database Management** (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis)
- **Cloud Platforms** (AWS, Azure, Serverless)
- **DevOps** (CI/CD pipelines, Docker, Kubernetes)
- **Authentication & Authorization** (OAuth, JWT, SSO)
- **Performance Optimization** (Caching, Load Balancing, Query Optimization)

🌱 **Currently, I'm focusing on:**
- Building **serverless applications** with **AWS Lambda** and **API Gateway**.
- Improving **frontend performance** with **React** and **Redux**.
- Developing **event-driven architectures** and real-time data processing using **Kafka** and **RabbitMQ**.

💬 Would be so excited to discuss **full-stack development**, **Node.js**, **React**, or any other aspect of scalable system design and new tech.
